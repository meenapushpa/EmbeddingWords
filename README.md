# EmbeddingWords

This repo contains the pretrained embedding words based python scripts which will print the output into excel sheets.

1. Pretrained words with embedding
2. Pretrained words without embedding

All above methods used from keras and tensorflow library to find out the accuracy of given dataset and compare them against the output which it produced. Each python module used to print the outputs in seperate spreadsheets with the below names.

WithEmbeddingConsolidate.xlsx

Addition to that, this modules will help us to find the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score Values for each method is calculated in next sheet of corresponding spreadsheets.
